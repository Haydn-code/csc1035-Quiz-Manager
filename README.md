CSC1035 Project 2 (Team Project)
================================

This package is build as a part of the Programming Portfolio (2) - CSC1035 and CSC1036

For this project we created a quiz management system. We created a variety of different classes:
A menu class,
A class to CRUD different quizes,
A class to CRUD different questions,
A class for importing exporting using JSON,
A class for accepting responses to questions, running quiz, logging results,
A class for querying the database,
Creating the database,
Classes for connecting entities to database,
A class for testing.

You can run the programme from the menu class. Determining what the program will do
is based off the user input as you can see from lines 37-52 in menu.java file.
